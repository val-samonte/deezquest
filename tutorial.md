# Basic of a Match-3 game

The game starts with an 8x8 game board with random symbols in it.
Simply select any symbol on the board that you want to swap, then click another adjacent symbol to make a move. 
If you're able to make a row of 3 or more of a same symbol, you have made a match.
Unlike other match 3 games, any swap move is valid, regardless if you have made a match or not.

# The objective of the game

Both your hero and your opponent's have their each respective hit points or HP.
The objective of the game is to defeat your opponent by setting his / her HP to 0.
There is a maximum of 50 turns in a match. If you and your opponent both managed to survive, the hero with the highest HP wins.
A match may result to a draw if both you and your opponent has the same HP when the maximum turn is reached.

# Your Hero and its attributes

Every hero has 4 attributes derived from its public address.
1. Intelligence - Affects the total MP and bonus mana absorption points of the hero.
2. Speed - Affects the turn frequency of the hero. The bigger the gap of the speed between you and the opponent, the more frequent your hero can make a turn.
3. Vitality - Affects the total HP of your hero, increasing its survivability.
4. Strength - Affects the base damage and carrying capacity of your hero. The bigger the carrying capacity, the more capable the hero to equip heavier items.

# The symbols on the board: Commands and Mana Stones

There are 7 different kinds of symbols in the game which are separated in 2 categories:
1. Commands - The sword, shield and amulet symbols are commands. Matching 3 or more of these in a turn will let your hero execute the respective command.
2. Mana Stones - Are the mana resources needed for your hero to cast skills. The fire, wind, water and earth stones belong to this category.

# Basic commands: Attack and Defend

If you managed to match 3 or more sword symbols but do not have sufficient mana to cast an offensive skill, you are executing an Attack Command.
The Attack Command simply deals physical damage to your opponent based on how many sword symbols that you managed to match plus the base damage of your hero.

If you managed to match 3 or more shield symbols but do not have sufficient mana to cast a supportive skill, you are executing a Defend Command.
The Defend Command increases your Shield Points which protects your hero to physical damage made by your opponent's Attack Command.

# What are skills and how to use them

1. Offensive Skill - 

# Skill Power Level
